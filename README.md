# Battery Status
Forked from [atom-battery-status](https://github.com/cmd-johnson/atom-battery-status) (created by Jonas Auer jonas.auer.94@gmail.com).
Displays the current power level of the battery in Atom's status bar, and
indicates if the battery is currently charging. Especially useful if you often
work in full-screen mode on your laptop!
Now BatteryStatus is Cross platform (window/mac/linux) compatibles.
